            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT cannot be denied but that the death of that worthy Gentleman Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury-Godfrey</hi> was that which firſt created ſo unanimous a belief of the reality of the Plot, but why it ſhould be charged upon the Papiſts, I could never yet ſee the leaſt ground of reaſon for: But to wave that and to come to the Parties executed for the Fact: For the two firſt, That allegation (though non ſenſicall to common reaſon) of an abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeeing at their Execution they profeſſed themſelves Romaniſts, may ſuffice: But ſhould a fobur Enquirer ask, how came <hi>Berry</hi> the laſt of them, both to profeſs himſelf a Proteſtant, according to the eſtlabiſhed Church, and that more then ſeemingly he was never otherwiſe? and likewiſe ſo poſitively to deny the Fact, or any knowledge thereof? ſure he could not be lull'd into any blinde zeal for promotion (as termed) of the Cauſe, all mental reſervations as well as Indulgences being there out of doors: But it may well be ſaid of this his Confeſſion or Declaration (which you pleaſe to call it) as was of the Evidences againſt Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> and the reſt, <hi>That it was ſham'd over:</hi> Give me leave to note to yo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the ſtrangeneſs of a Vote in Parliament, much about that time, <hi>viz.</hi> that it being a helliſh and damnable Plot of the Papiſts, <hi>Should his Majeſty miſcarry</hi> (without exception by what hand) <hi>that his Death ſhould be revenged upon the fore-mentioned Parties;</hi> This being but a Vote, and that now no Parliament, I think it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be over-criminal to mention who were the propoſers, and what ſort condeſcended I ſhall leave you to judge: however I could not but obſerve in his Majeſties late indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, how buſy the ſmall Agents were, at every end of the Town, buzsing about, his being Poyſoned; the end is eaſily gues'd at; and no doubt, but them ſtyled Masked Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, would equally have participated of the malice, not for Religion, but Loyalty ſake; I ſhall inſtance 2 or 3 reaſons why (in my opinion) the reall fire ought to be ſought for, at another door, then the ſmoak ſeems to come forth at: and therefore, to caſt an eye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the merits of the Good old Cauſe, ſhall fix a jealouſy there: Firſt, the Rebellion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which though the Glorious <hi>Monmouth</hi> no ſooner appeared, then defeated, yet had they ſucceeded, no doubt but would have ſound (or rather were aſſured of) a great deal of encouragement from this our Nation; but what they would have done for ſoon a Shooing horn deviſe, as the ſecond Article in the late Covenant was, I know not, (though the fained care of his Majeſty and People doth much reſemble thoſe times) as alſo for a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; for I am ſure none but a very young one would accept it from their hands eſpecially, and have put confidence in them, for <hi>Richard Cromwells</hi> ſake: Secondly, it may be obſerved,
<pb facs="tcp:104208:2"/>that few or none (the Leſſer men excepted) are the ſticklers for a Plot, but what were either actually in the Late Rebellion, or whoſe Father was: and it were pity to ſpoil the old Proverb, too be of other opinion then that what was bred in the Bone would not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily out of the fleſh: and to add further, there hath ſcarſe been an Election for the New Parliament, where any ancient Royaliſt was a Competitor, but that ſome Raſcall would brand him, with the Title of masked Papiſt, or Courtier; which is now a Character al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as obnoxious to the Rebellious Commonalty as the Former, a reſemblance too much of the Late Rebellion; And laſtly, to confirm this my belief, the daily endeavours of your ever-oppoſite Party to Monarchy, to ingratiate themſelves with the Eſtabliſhed Church, by their printed Papers, in which they ſtile themſelves only Diſſenting Brethren; And to prevent impartiall Eyes from being caſt that way, they repeat the expreſſions of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Father, when moved in Late Parliament, that they ought to be looked after as well as the Papiſts; whoſe Reply was, that the one might take him by the ſlieve, but the other would by the throat: but by the Reverend Lords favour, if not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, when took by the ſlieve, I think his Can had a remove too. Its true, we have bare ſuggeſtions of the one, but too late experience of the other; it is likewiſe worthy obſervation the Conformity of theſe Grandees of late in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing once a moneth at their Pariſh Churches; a bare Cloak for their deſigns: for when there in the Morning, you ſhall not fail of them, at Rebellions, School (I mean the Meeting houſes) in the Afternoon, for fear of giving ſcandal to a weak brother, and ſo loſe a Vote when in Computation for a Lay Elderſhip: and no doubt but theſe ſort of Monſters have an itching deſire to be examining (that is) into Crown and Church-Lands: but to return to the Hinges of the Plot: give me leave to put you in minde of the Iriſh Ruffians, heretofore ſo often mentioned; which materials being at laſt found, the devil's in't, after ſo much conſideration, and pains, the Eggs ſhould prove addle: No, for at the meeting of the Parliament you may well expect more of them: (that is) by that time the Birds will not only be fledg'd but likewiſe have their feathers, ſo artificially placed, as to ſet defiance both to winde and weather; but then ſhould their ambition ſo decked, make them ſo high flyers, as to aim at Eclipſing the Sun; and by that means cauſe ſo great a diſlocation in their plumes, as nakedly to reveal themſelves, the Workman, if not damn'd impudent, ſurely muſt ſneak. It is not eaſy without pre conſideration to judge how far crocked revenge, though lapped in a decrepid carcaſe, yet annexed to an unlimited Conſcience, may extend: but for fear of being too troubleſome to you, I ſhall conclude ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the dictates of my ſpirit, that is, to pray, that God would grant his Majeſty long Life; and that he may know his real friends from them crept under that Cloak; as alſo never want power to controul them, nor a Legitimate Heir to ſucceed, without tripping over the Right of ſucceſſion: So if what already alledged, is not a ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for not being vulgarly Credulous, yet I doubt not but will neceſſitate you to conclude him impartial, that is,</p>
